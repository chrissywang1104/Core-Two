			<span style="font-size: 120px;">A</span>nd when the party entered the assembly room it consisted only of five all together, – Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.
		</p>
<!--   -->
		<p class="two">
			<span style="font-size: 150px;">M</span>r. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; 
			<span id="italic">but his friend</span>

			soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a-year. The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a

					<span class="popuptext3" id="myPopup3" style="color: red;">THREE</span>
			<!--	</span>  -->
				to be compared with his friend.<span>
		</p>

		<p class="three">
			<span style="font-size: 250px;">M</span>r. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves. 
			<!--	<span class="popup3" onclick="myFunction()"> -->
				<span id="bold" style="font-size: 60px; text-decoration: underline blue;"><span id="italic">What a contrast between him and his friend!</span></span>

			<!--	</span>  -->
			<span id="bold">Mr. Darcy</span> 
			<span id="italic"> danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His character was decided. He was the 
			<!--	<span class="popup3" onclick="myFunction()"> -->
				<span id="bold" style="font-size: 60px; text-decoration: underline blue;">proudest, most disagreeable man in the world,</span> 
				<span class="popuptext5" id="myPopup5" style="color: red;">Manners maketh man.</span>
			<!--	</span>  -->
			 and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.</span> 
			Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters.
		</p>

		<p class="four">
			<span id="bold"><span style="font-size: 300px;">E</span>lizabeth Bennet</span> 
			had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, 
			<span id="bold">Mr. Darcy</span> 
			had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join in.
		</p>

		<p class="five">
			<span style="font-size: 350px;">C</span>ome, 
			<span id="bold">Darcy</span>
			,” said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better dance.”
		</p>

		<p class="six">
			<span id="italic"><span style="font-size: 350px;">I</span> certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and 
			
			<span class="popup5" onclick="myFunction()">
				<span id="italic" style="font-size: 110px; text-decoration: underline blue;">there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with.”</span> 
				<span class="popuptext6" id="myPopup6" style="color: red;">Ouch.</span>
			</span>
		</span>
		</p>

		<p class="seven">
			<span style="font-size: 400px;">I</span> would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Bingley, “for a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty.”
		</p>

		<p class="eight">
			<span id="italic"><span style="font-size: 450px;">Y</span>
			<span class="popup5" onclick="myFunction()">
				<span id="italic" style="font-size: 130px; text-decoration: underline blue;">ou are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,”</span> 
				<span class="popuptext6" id="myPopup6" style="color: red;">Watch your mouth</span>
			</span>
			
		
		</span> 
			said 
			<span id="bold">Mr. Darcy,</span> 
			looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.
		</p>

		<p class="nine">
			<span style="font-size: 500px;">O</span>h! she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.”
		</p>

		<p class="ten">
			<span id="italic"><span style="font-size: 560px;">W</span>hich do you mean?”</span> 
			and turning round he looked for a moment at 
			<span id="bold">Elizabeth,</span>
			<span id="italic"> till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said, “She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me; and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.”</span>
		</p>


		
		<p class="eleven" style="font-size: 160px; line-height: 10%;">
			<span style="font-size: 620px;">M</span>r. Bingley followed his advice. 
			<span id="bold">Mr. Darcy</span> 
			walked off; and 
			<span id="bold">Elizabeth</span>
			<span id="italic"> remained with no very cordial feelings towards him.</span> 
			She told the story, however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.
